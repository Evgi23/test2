### Project Description
Guess the random number made by computer in the minimum number of attempts

:arrow_up: [To Table of contents](__)

## What case we are solving?
We need to write a program for guessing the random number in the minimum number of 

**Competition conditions**
- The computer chooses random number from 0 to 100. We need to guess it that is to write the program which guesses the number.
- The algorithm takes into account if the guessed number more or less random number.

**Quality metric**
The result is assessed by the average number of attempts per 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**
We lean to code good python in VC.
